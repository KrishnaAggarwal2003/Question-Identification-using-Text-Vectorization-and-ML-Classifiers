# Question-Identification-using-Text-Vectorization-and-ML-Classifiers
This project aims to identify questions in text dataset using various text vectorization techniques and classical machine learning classifiers. The workflow includes preprocessing text, transforming it into numerical representations, and evaluating multiple classifiers to determine which combination yields the best performance.
